Build a Jekyll list of your static content in seconds, without touching the command line

## Installation

1. Fork this repository

2. Go to Settings->GitHub Pages, select `master branch` then click on the `Save` button

With the GitHub Pages activation, your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/jeklist

## Change theme

1. Go to Settings->GitHub Pages then click on the `Change theme` button

2. Select one of the available themes then click on the `Select theme` button

## Configuration

All the configuration is done in the `_config.yml` file. Set `extensions` and `directories` to restrict the content you want to show. Set `style`, `spacification`, `truncate` and `html_link` to modify the presentation look.

Example to only show `pdf` and `md` files from the `Papers` directory in a `list` truncated to `60` chars and with `html_link` for the `md` files :

```
style: list
extensions:
  - .pdf
  - .md
directories:
  - Papers
truncate: 60
html_link:
  - .md
```

Besides nothing, `style` option can have three values:
- `list` for a flat bullet list
- `nlist` for a flat numbered list
- `dir` for a first level directory structure

The `spacification` option can be useful when `style` is set to `dir`, to replace a selected char by a space in the directory names.
